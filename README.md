# Interview Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks

This Flask-based application predicts the likelihood of a candidate's success in an interview using a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The project integrates a machine learning model with a web interface to provide predictions based on candidate attributes.

---

## Features

- Predict interview outcomes using an Artificial Neural Network.
- User-friendly web interface built with Flask.
- Accepts candidate details as input and provides prediction results.
- Customizable and extendable for other use cases in HR analytics.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.8 or above
- Flask
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`


## How It Works

1. **Model Training**: The ANN model was trained on a labeled dataset containing features like education, experience, and other candidate attributes.
2. **Web Application**: Flask serves as the backend framework to host the model and handle user input.
3. **Prediction**: User input is preprocessed and fed into the trained ANN model, which outputs the probability of success.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: For web development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the Artificial Neural Network.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For front-end design.
- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.

## Future Enhancements

- Add authentication for user access.
- Incorporate real-time data updates and analytics.
- Extend the model to handle additional datasets.
